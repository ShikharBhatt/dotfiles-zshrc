Enjoy the tweaks

Powerlevel9k / Powerlevel10k themes

Powerlevel10k comes with a configuration setup - Run the command: `p10k configure`
It gives a list of options which one may choose to get a desired appearance.

It generates .p10k.zsh file in which one can make changes and setup their own configurations.

Hope you'll enjoy it.
